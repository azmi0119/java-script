asyn -> 

defer -> defer is say that first HTML code will be loaded after that js file will be load.

var -> 


let -> If you decalare any variable of name t hen you can not redeclared same of of varaible in same javascript file .
Note1 :- How you can resolve it ?
Ans  :- You can easily resolve it with anonymous function .

test1.js file example : (function() {
			let x =10;
			let y =20;
			document.write(x+y);
		})();
test2.js file example : (function() {
			let x =30;
			let y =50;
			document.write(x*y);
		})();

Note2 -: You can call anonymous function easily, You can hold the function into a variable and with that variable name you can call your anonymous function .

Example below :
	var x = function(){
		document.write("Hello anonymous function, and call it with variable name");
	} 
	x();

const -> variable value can not be change after declaration

typeof
data types
	string
	number
	boolean
	array -> when you print arrays values in javascript then it will show result into object .
	object -> When you print object value in javascript then it will also show result into object.
	null 
	undefined

Q2: Explain DEFAULT constraint in MySQL  
Answer : DEFAULT constraint provides a default value to a column. In case a row is inserted into the table and no value is provided to the column, the default value is taken.
Consider a table Customer created using statement below.

Q3: Explain foreign key in MySQL  

Q4: What is primary key constraint and unique key constraints?  
Answer
Primary key is a column or a group of columns in table which uniquely identifies a row in database. A primary key column can not have NULL value. Values in primary key column or columns must be unique so that a row or entry can be uniquely identified using primary key.
Unique key constraint ensures that values entered in a column are unique. Although primary key values will be unique, you might want to ensure that some other column also has non-duplicate entries. For example if we have multiple users and want to ensure that no two users with same email id are added to the table, we can put UNIQUE key constraint on email_id column. NULL values are ignored in case of Unique key constraint which means NULL is allowed value for email id in this case.


Q5: How are VARCHAR and CHAR different. Talk about cases where you will use one over other.  
1. CHAR stores characters of fixed length while VARCHAR can store characters of variable length.
2. CHAR has memory allocation equivalent to the maximum size specified while VARCHAR has variable length memory allocation.
 
Q6: Describe BLOB in MySQL. What is it used for? 
Answer :
BLOB or Binary Large Object can be used to store binary data in MySQL. Sometimes binary data like images need to be stored in SQL databases. For example you might want to store user photos along with other user details in the database table. Binary data of the user photo can be saved as a BLOB. By using BLOB, we will not require separate storage for images. BLOB helps in removing complexity and providing portability in such cases.

 
Q7: What is an AGGREGATE function. Name few aggregate functions used in MySQL.  

Q.8: What is the difference between TRUNCATE and DELETE?  Related To: SQL
Ans: Trucate : It is use when you want to delete you data without distroying table structures that time we can use TRUNCATE
	 DELETE : It is use when you want to delete data as well structure of table aslo that time we can use DELETE .

Q9: What is the difference between Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML)? Related To: SQL, T-SQL, Databases 

Answer
Data definition language (DDL) commands are the commands which are used to define the database. CREATE, ALTER, DROP and TRUNCATE are some common DDL commands.
Data manipulation language (DML) commands are commands which are used for manipulation or modification of data. INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE are some common DML commands.

Q22: What is use of setInterval() function ?
Ans: 
	1. The setInterval() method calls a function or evaluates an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds).

	2. The setInterval() method will continue calling the function until clearInterval() is called, or the window is closed.

	3. The ID value returned by setInterval() is used as the parameter for the clearInterval() method.

	Tip 1: 1000 ms = 1 second.

	Tip 2: To execute a function only once, after a specified number of milliseconds, use the setTimeout() method.

Q23: What is use of setTimeout() function ?
Ans: 
	1. The setTimeout() method calls a function or evaluates an expression after a specified number of milliseconds.

	Tip 1: 1000 ms = 1 second.

	Tip 2: The function is only executed once. If you need to repeat execution, use the setInterval() method.

	Tip 3: Use the clearTimeout() method to prevent the function from running.


Q24: What is use of clearTimeout() function ?
Ans: 
	1. The clearTimeout() method clears a timer set with the setTimeout() method.

	2. The ID value returned by setTimeout() is used as the parameter for the clearTimeout() method.
